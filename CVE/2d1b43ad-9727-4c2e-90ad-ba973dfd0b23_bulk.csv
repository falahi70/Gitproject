Resource properties secured with the security option of the ApiPlatform\Metadata\ApiProperty attribute can be disclosed to unauthorized users. The problem affects most serialization formats including raw JSON which is enabled by default when installing API Platform. Custom serialization formats may also be impacted. Only collection endpoints are affected by the issue item endpoints are not. The JSON-LD format is not affected by the issue. The result of the security rule is only executed for the first item of the collection. The result of the rule is then cached and reused for the next items. This bug can leak data to unauthorized users when the rule depends on the value of a property of the item. This bug can also hide properties that should be displayed to authorized users. This issue impacts the 2.7 3.0 and 3.1 branches. Please upgrade to versions 2.7.10 3.0.12 or 3.1.3.

CVE-2022-41725,0,-,-,-,https://go.dev/issue/58006,A denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption in net/http and mime/multipart. Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile FormValue ParseMultipartForm and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter and is documented as storing up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory. File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form such as map entry overhead part names and MIME headers permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface types documentation states If stored on disk the Files underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.. This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,2023-02-28 18:15:00,2023-02-28 20:33:00

To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to be configured but the operation does not require any privilege. There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock. When CONFIG_TLS is enabled user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener the context is inherited and vulnerable. The setsockopt TCP_ULP operation does not require any privilege. We recommend upgrading past commit 2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,2023-02-28 15:15:00,2023-02-28 16:47:00

Versions prior to 1.0.1 are vulnerable to SQL Injection leading to a Denial of Service. If the user selects (in user preferences) the Recently Visited Packages view for the index page the value of the search_history cookie is used as a base64 encoded comma separated list of atoms. These are string loaded directly into the SQL query with atom = %s format string. As a result any user can modify the browsers cookie value and inject most SQL queries. A proof of concept malformed cookie was generated that wiped the database or changed its content. On the database only public data is stored so there is no confidentiality issues to site users. If it is known that the database was modified a full restoration of data is possible by performing a full database wipe and performing full update of all components. This issue is patched with commit id 5ae9ca83b73. Version 1.0.1 contains the patch. If users are unable to upgrade immediately the following workarounds may be applied: (1.) Use a proxy to always drop the search_history cookie until upgraded. The impact on user experience is low. (2.)

Versions prior to 5.0.13 are subject to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. LiteDB uses a special field in JSON documents to cast different types from BsonDocument to POCO classes. When instances of an object are not the same of class BsonMapper use a special field _type string info with full class name with assembly to be loaded and fit into your model. If your end-user can send to your app a plain JSON string deserialization can load an unsafe object to fit into your model. This issue is patched in version 5.0.13 with some basic fixes to avoid this but is not 100% guaranteed when using Object type. The next major version will contain an allow-list to select what kind of Assembly can be loaded. Workarounds are detailed in the vendor advisory.,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,2023-02-24 23:15:00,2023-02-24 23:48:00

The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory.

Versions from 0.9.0 to 0.12.0 (including) did not properly fail blocking read operations on TLS connections when the transport hit timeouts. Instead it entered an endless loop retrying the read operation consuming CPU resources. This could be exploited for denial of service attacks. If trace level logging was enabled it would also produce an excessive amount of log output during the loop consuming disk space.

CVE-2023-25657,0,-,-,-,https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/sandbox/#sandbox,Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. All users of Nautobot versions earlier than 1.5.7 are impacted by a remote code execution vulnerability. Nautobot did not properly sandbox Jinja2 template rendering. In Nautobot 1.5.7 has enabled sandboxed environments for the Jinja2 template engine used internally for template rendering for the following objects: extras.ComputedField extras.CustomLink extras.ExportTemplate extras.Secret extras.Webhook. While no active exploits of this vulnerability are known this change has been made as a preventative measure to protect against any potential remote code execution attacks utilizing maliciously crafted template code. This change forces the Jinja2 template engine to use a SandboxedEnvironment on all new installations of Nautobot. This addresses any potential unsafe code execution everywhere the helper function nautobot.utilities.utils.render_jinja2 is called. Additionally the documentation that had previously suggesting the direct use of jinja2.Template has been revised to suggest render_jinja2. Users are advised to upgrade to Nautobot 1.5.7 or newer. For users that are unable to upgrade to the latest release of Nautobot you may add the following setting to your nautobot_config.py to apply the sandbox environment enforcement: TEMPLATES[1][OPTIONS][environment] = jinja2.sandbox.SandboxedEnvironment After applying this change you must restart all Nautobot services including any Celery worker processes. **Note:** *Nautobot specifies two template engines by default the first being “django” for the Django built-in template engine and the second being “jinja” for the Jinja2 template engine. This recommended setting will update the second item in the list of template engines which is the Jinja2 engine.* For users that are unable to immediately update their configuration such as if a Nautobot service restart is too disruptive to operations access to provide custom Jinja2 template values may be mitigated using permissions to restrict “change” (write) actions to the affected object types listed in the first section. **Note:** *This solution is intended to be stopgap until you can successfully update your nautobot_config.py or upgrade your Nautobot instance to apply the sandboxed environment enforcement.*,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,2023-02-21 21:15:00,2023-02-22 14:03:00
